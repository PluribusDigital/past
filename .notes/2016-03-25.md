**Status Check after Vacay**

```shell
Failed to mount folders in Linux guest. This is usually because
the "vboxsf" file system is not available. Please verify that
the guest additions are properly installed in the guest and
can work properly. The command attempted was:

mount -t vboxsf -o uid=`id -u vagrant`,gid=`getent group vagrant | cut -d: -f3` home_vagrant /home/vagrant
mount -t vboxsf -o uid=`id -u vagrant`,gid=`id -g vagrant` home_vagrant /home/vagrant

The error output from the last command was:

/sbin/mount.vboxsf: mounting failed with the error: No such device
```

* [Ideas](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/5503)
* Also, remembering to `vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest`
  + After the sequence: `vagrant reload` with install, `vagrant reload` => success!

######Can't Reach Server

+ *on staging.stsiinc.com* => `curl localhost:8081` => success
+ *on ESSOS* => `http://staging.stsiinc.com:8081/patent/` => no answer
  + firewall rule must have reset

######Checking AWS

+ [http://bit.ly/1Rj7HyO](http://www.past-ui.8f39979b.svc.dockerapp.io/) => Success

**Manual Reseeding Process**

- [x] Execute `pasp-extract.sql` to make CSV versions of the tables in a temporary directory
- [x] Compare the files in the temporary directory to `./past/tuesday/db/seed`
  + [x] Verify some files are identical and some are not
- [x] (*in vagrant shell*) `./tuesday/build-test.sh`
  + [x] Verify the seeding happened with no issues
- [x] (*in vagrant shell*) `./package.sh`
- [x] (*in dev OS*) `del tuesday-db-seed-2016-03-14.tar.gz`
- [x] (*in dev OS*) `copy tuesday-db-seed.tar.gz tuesday-db-seed-2016-03-14.tar.gz`
- [x] Upload to [s3](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=us-east-1#&bucket=stsi-past&prefix=)
  + [x] Make sure `Make Everything Public` is checked in the permissions view
- [x] (*in vagrant shell*) `./tuesday/build-db.sh && ./tuesday/run-db.sh`
  + [x] Verify the seeding happened with no issues
- [x] (*in vagrant shell*) `./tuesday/run-www.sh`
  + [x] Verify new files at [localhost](http://localhost:5000/document?limit=11000)
- [x] (*in vagrant shell*) `docker push stsilabs/past-tuesday-db`
- [x] Refresh [Tuesday DB Service in Cloud](https://cloud.docker.com/container/service/3a2b6992-6537-4c61-a43f-a975c740e01c/show/)
  + [x] Turn off 'Reuse existing container volumes?'
  + [x] Verify new files at [past-ui](http://www.past-ui.8f39979b.svc.dockerapp.io/document?limit=11000)
