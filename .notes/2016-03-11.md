```ruby
require 'getoptlong'

opts = GetoptLong.new(
        [ '--no-compose', GetoptLong::OPTIONAL_ARGUMENT ]
)
run_compose = true
opts.each do |opt, arg|
 case opt
   when '--no-compose'
    run_compose = false
 end
end
```

`vagrant reload`

```
An action 'reload' was attempted on the machine 'default',
but another process is already executing an action on the machine.
Vagrant locks each machine for access by only one process at a time
Please wait until the other Vagrant process finishes modifying this
machine, then try again.

If you believe this message is in error, please check the process
listing for any "ruby" or "vagrant" processes and kill them. Then
try again.
